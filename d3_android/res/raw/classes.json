Their massive strength allows them to equip heavy shields, and their flesh deflects oncoming blades and teeth like metal armor."}],"resource":" The rage that fills true barbarians cannot be extinguished so long as they live. Fury, a resource that represents pure anger and battle-lust, powers their every terrifying strike. Fury rises in barbarians as they are damaged, and when they draw their enemies' blood. As barbarians suffer increasing damage from their enemies (and quickly cut them down in response) their Fury builds to a peak. Excess Fury can be put to explosive use - barbarians can smash and destroy the battlefield, hurl themselves through the air, and split their opponents in two. Outside of combat, Fury wanes quickly, so adept Barbarians charge from battle to battle to ensure that they can continually deliver devastating attacks.","resource-type":"Fury","description":" Barbarians are savage wanderers who never flinch from close-quarters combat. Mighty ground stomps, leaping attacks and dual-wielded slashes leave a barbarian's enemies dead in their boots and send any survivors fleeing for cover. Thanks to their size and strength, barbarians can dominate a melee with nearly any combination of weapon and approach, though they tend towards massive and imposing weaponry. Barbarians are no strangers to the pains of battle, and often fare better in the midst of several opponents, taking and giving cuts, than when attempting to chase down single targets. Barbarians' attacks are primarily melee focused. Their quick weapon swings whittle down the number of weaker foes in seconds, while their slower, ground-shaking slams and stomps can send approaching hordes reeling and crack the armor of mightier foes. ","lore":" For ages, the barbarians dwelling in the shadow of Mount Arreat were shaped to be as strong and unyielding as stone. Immense in size and unmatched in ferocity, they were charged from birth with a duty passed through generations: to protect the sacred mountain. When their homeland was shattered, many barbarians lost faith. They became aimless, haunted by their past, traveling from place to place without honor or direction. But not all barbarians have given up their vigil. Some still honor the harsh snows of Arreat's summit and prowl the outskirts of its crater. They recall being handed axes and spears at an age when city children were clinging to their toys... and they burn with shame at the failure of their people. These barbarians strive to find a new purpose for themselves in a changed world, and they will crush any who stand in their way.","equipment":" Barbarians are able to make use of weapons in ways that others simply don't possess the strength for. They wield massive weapons - oversized killing devices that more urbane heroes are barely strong enough to lift, let alone swing. Heavily-muscled barbarians can also dual-wield normal weapons like swords and axes, barraging foes with multiple enchantments and weapon types at once.","tier-1":"Early on in their journey, padded leather provides untested barbarians with basic protection...but most enemy attacks will still fall upon their unarmored skin.","tier-2":"A greater variety of gear to choose from means that barbarians can shield their vitals with close-faced helms, imposing spikes, and armor plates.","tier-3":"Barbarians bedecked in truly heavy armor look more like nightmare visions than humans, and they have the resilience to match.","active-skills":[{"name":"Bash","required-level":1,"icon":"barbarian_bash","type":"Primary","generate":6,"generate-units":"Fury","generate-description":"per attack","description":" Brutally smash an enemy for 150% weapon damage with a 20% chance to Knockback.","runes":[{"required-level":6,"name":"Clobber","description":"Instead of Knockback, each hit has a 35% chance to Stun the target for 1.5 seconds.","icon":"rune_c"},{"required-level":13,"name":"Onslaught","description":"Add 2 reverberations that cause 22% weapon damage per strike.

They hold no hope for a return to their former lives, but they fight and stalk demons with a passion. Those hunters who live to train others become deliberate and cautious and, yet, their impulses scream to meet demonic violence with more violence. Every arrow that demon hunters launch is dipped in spite; nearly all of their attacks are delivered with Hatred, a cold, righteous anger that renders them utterly merciless to their enemies. Their Hatred is nearly endless; it recovers quickly, as, even at rest, demon hunters are filled with the desire for vengeance. Those hunters who would hope to make any sort of true impact must temper their Hatred with a second resource: Discipline, the caution and care that ensures they live to kill another day. Discipline is precious to demon hunters. Not only does it return slowly, requiring more reflection and patience than their Hatred-based attacks, but they must rely on it for every defensive maneuver - trapping enemies in place, vaulting out of the way of teeth and claws, and dodging hails of spines and arrows. It is a simple matter for demon hunters to stand in place, icy with Hatred, and send a volley of projectiles at the hordes of their enemies. But, when they fail to defend themselves with Discipline, hunters leave themselves able to be slaughtered. A careful balance of Discipline and Hatred is the most likely way hunters ensure their survival.","resource-type":"Hatred\/ Discipline","description":" Demon hunters are relentless vigilantes who execute their infernal targets with an arsenal of ranged weapons. They crouch and take aim far from danger, relying on bows, deadly traps, and projectiles to swiftly bring an end to the creatures that haunt their world. With sweeping blasts of shot, wide salvos of arrows and timed explosives at their disposal, demon hunters excel at devastating groups of foes who cluster together. Hunters' pinpoint accuracy also allows them to deal with stronger monsters at a distance: they can snipe at key targets or fall back while snapping off kill shots at advancing foes. However, demon hunters' focus on ranged combat and limited melee-weapons training leave them in danger when they're cornered or surrounded. Evasive skills like defensive rolls and jumps, as well as targeted attacks that hamstring and slow enemies, are as crucial to survival as any arrow in a hunter's quiver. ","lore":" Those who call themselves demon hunters are not a people or a nation. They owe allegiance to no king. They are but a remnant - an echo - of those who've lost their lives to hellspawn. When their homes are burnt and their families butchered by demons, most newly scarred refugees give up on living - but a few bury their dead, band together, and swear vengeance. Though they are small in number, hunters track and corner demons in the hopes that, if they can save even one life, their world will be better for it. At the end of a day's hunt, most still close their eyes and have nightmares in which they see the horrors that brought them together: gore-caked claws, and men and women drowning in their own blood. Awake, demon hunters see much the same. But, now, in the present, they finally have the power to retaliate. They dare not dream of victory, or, even less likely, peace. And yet, they hunt. They can do nothing else.","equipment":" Demon hunters train to hold back the darkness with unconventional combinations of weaponry and fighting styles that only they can employ. They are masters of the hand crossbow - quick-reloading, fast-firing ranged weapons that they use to turn demons into their temporary quivers. Demon hunters are so adept in the hand crossbow's use that they can dual wield them; two crossbows fired together doubles the arrows in the air and the speed at which hunters' enemies die.","tier-1":"Fledgling demon hunters wear light, flexible leather to guard their wrists and throat, and hoods to hide their faces and blend in with shadows.

Spirit replenishes slowly. It is generated in two ways - by specific skills and attacks, and by the completion of combos. Monks who chain their attacks carefully can continue a near-endless barrage of Spirit-fueled strikes. Spirit is a valuable resource, but massive expenditures of this force allow a monk to call upon potent dodges and defensive moves, as well as monster-slaying finishing strikes.

Healing waves, mantras of protection and attacks empowered with holy might are all within their purview. Skilled monks deliver rapid-fire attacks unarmed or with a variety of well-balanced weapons. In combat, they emphasize high maneuverability over staying power, darting in and out of melees and avoiding protracted slugfests. Monks' attacks are primarily melee-focused. They can eliminate single foes with extreme damage, or deliver short-range area-of-effect assaults with waves of elemental power that emanate from palm strikes or crescent kicks. ","lore":" Monks of the Sahptev faith train their bodies and minds so that they may become the foremost holy warriors of the land of Ivgorod. Within the cloisters of the Patriarchs, the monks endure harsh trials both physical and spiritual, proving their devotion and attaining unmatched focus. Daily ritualistic cleansings help monks purify their spirits and overcome the corruption that gnaws at the hearts of all men. In the pursuit of martial perfection, they also hone their legendary balance and clarity, skills that allow them to master both unarmed combat and a diverse array of weapons. After a lifetime of preparation, anointed monks are permitted to leave their monasteries' halls to serve the decrees of the Patriarchs. The emblem on their foreheads marks them as survivors, achievers, and pillars of their society. Monks embody the will of Ivgorod's one thousand and one gods in every step and every strike.","equipment":" Monks' martial forms commonly incorporate specialized weaponry. Even monks' naked fists are vessels of destruction, but they can be augmented with fist weapons like the katar, a punch-dagger that's held in one or both hands and stabbed forth at the enemy.

Mana is a vast but slowly-regenerating resource; witch doctors must be choosy with their attack spells and hexes to ensure that they don't leave themselves depleted of power and exposed to enemy attacks. Since Mana returns ponderously, witch doctors conserve it by relying on semi-permanent additions to their arsenal, such as their summoned mongrels and the horrific gargantuan, which can offer protection and chew through enemies without any further mana cost. Witch doctors have a sizeable reservoir of energy to call upon at once, and, when they need to, they can deploy immense blasts of destructive force and cut a swath across nearly any battleground in a short period of time.","resource-type":"Mana","description":" Witch doctors are spiritual warriors who summon dead souls and crawling creatures to do their bidding. By surrounding themselves with conjured zombies and vermin, witch doctors are free to assault their enemies with exploding skulls, acrid poison clouds, and wasting curses. The ability to infect, slow and terrify their enemies gives witch doctors unprecedented control over a battlefield. They can manipulate opposing attacks and movements with debuffs and crowd control spells, rendering enemies easy prey for hungry pets. Witch doctors can also lay down fields of fire and venom that slowly leech life from advancing foes. Although some witch doctors avoid melee combat in favor of augmenting their pets and crippling their enemies from afar, they are also more than capable of slaying weakened foes with their own hands. ","lore":" Only a select few men and women among the umbaru tribes can ascend to the hallowed role of witch doctor, for they must possess both a history of battle and a talent for communing with spirits. The latter ability belongs solely to those born with the touch of the Unformed Land - the invisible realm where the umbaru believe the spirits of the dead dwell once they have left Sanctuary behind. When a man dies, witch doctors feel what they suspect is the breath of life leaving his cooling body. And, when calamity or genocide sends hundreds to their graves at once, witch doctors can sense their trembling and shrieking from beyond. Witch doctors cannot cover their ears to the voices of the spirits. As the sounds of disquiet grow louder, their choice is made. They must restore the balance between their world and the Unformed Land, or watch the torment of generations past for the rest of their lives... and forever after.","equipment":" Though witch doctors make use of a variety of weaponry, they boast several one-of-a-kind pieces of equipment. Mojos are fragile talismans held in the off-hand; instead of being used directly as weapons, they aid witch doctors in warding off the wrong dark forces...and calling out to the right ones. Witch doctors have also been known to carry enchanted ceremonial daggers. Unlike common knives, these blades are honed towards one purpose - human sacrifice - and so they are well-suited to ending lives.","tier-1":"The paint covering novice witch doctors' bodies almost serves as better protection than the fur and cloth they gird themselves with.","tier-2":"Experienced witch doctors are able to piece together superior defenses, augmenting their armor with fine metal plates and wicked-looking masks.","tier-3":"Well-girded witch doctors strike fear in the hearts of their foes with armor covered in ancient skulls, feathers and horns.

An intense energy courses through them, and they direct it as though it were an extension of their own bodies. Wizards continually crackle with Arcane Power - it regenerates itself quickly, and so they can call upon their lesser abilities seemingly without end. They are only in danger of depleting their stores of energy when attempting a number of invocations at once. However, Arcane Power can ravage wizards' bodies if its use is not carefully paced, so Wizards must endure a cooldown period before repeatedly casting certain potent spells. These spells - conjured meteors falling from the sky, torrents of force that shove multiple foes off their feet, or energy bubbles that halt the flow of time itself - are so powerful that they are worth the wait.","resource-type":"Arcane Power","description":" Wizards are renegade spellcasters who use their bodies as vessels for arcane energy, forsaking the more careful path favored by other magic users. They manipulate all manner of forces to disintegrate, burn, and freeze their foes, and they can control time and light to teleport, create powerful illusions, and deflect oncoming attacks. Wizards grip wands and staves to focus their less potent magics, blasting at their enemies while gathering the energy or time necessary to destroy them in a dazzling hail of arcane might. With few exceptions, wizard attacks are conducted at a distance, away from danger. As living artillery, wizards are well suited to relying on long-range destructive power. ","lore":" Magic-users hail from academies throughout Sanctuary - from Xiansai to Caldeum - bearing monikers like \"sorcerer\" and \"mage,\" but those who would refer to themselves with the derogatory epithet \"wizard\" are as similar to their fellow spellcasters as a lion is to a kitten. Wizards and sorcerers both wield the hidden mysteries of the arcane; there, the commonalities end. Wizards are known for a number of qualities: not only rebelliousness and flair, but also disdain for the endless lessons and prattling about caution and safety that echo from academic schools of magic. Wizards' superior attitudes seem to stem from their natural talent - their ability to wrestle the ambient force of magic into submission and direct it to their ends by will and instinct. Any accidents that might occur due to their lack of finesse are unfortunate...but that rarely stops wizards from indulging in their unstable power. If they can only master their double-edged gift and avoid destroying themselves, these upstart arcane prodigies may be able to finally reach the destiny that they see on the horizon.","equipment":" Though all material items serve as channels for the wizard's immense power, some have particularly special uses. Wizards wield orbs, which aren't quite weapons - instead, they're off-handed supplements that provide them with visions and knowledge to aid their spellcasting, or serve as reservoirs of power. Wizards also equip themselves with traditional (and often enchanted) wands, thin sticks that they use to direct monumental arcane forces at their targets.","tier-1":"Early wizard armor is quilted wear
